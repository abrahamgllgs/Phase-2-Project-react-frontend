# Project-Phase-2
# React + Vite
## Cocktail Finder

This application is something simple I made using the react + vite. In this app, you can search for a random cocktail or look for a list of margaritas to look through. They will include information such as name, cockatil type, alcohilc/non-alcholic, and instructions to make one yourself!

# Installation
```
1.Clone this repositroy to your local browser. 
2.To navigate to project directory use 'cd my-react-app"
3.Install project dependencays "npm install"
4.To start the development sereve "npm start"
5.This will start the server and open the app in web browser at "http://localhost:5174/"
```

## How it Works

```bash
1. The random cocktail search will be clicked by the user
2. The Api data will then render a random cocktail
3. The information will be displayed along with it ingredients.
4. The list of cockatils is also taken information from json serve allowing it to send data to make up the list of margaritas
5. The search bar can narrow down with key letters relating to margarita being search for.
6. The links below will also lead to blog post for this assignment and git hub for the project

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
